Every editor saves and asks the same way. `useCloseGuard({ isOpen, close, dirty })` guards a slideover that holds a small record's form: bound as `v-model:open`, `:dismissible` and `@close:prevent`, it makes Cancel, ×, Escape and an outside click ask "Discard unsaved changes?" while the form has unsaved changes and close at once while it has none, and `leave()` asks the same before another row or a new record replaces the form.

Roles, invitations and redirects open in a slideover instead of a card above the list: the form in the body, its message at the top (success green, failure red), Cancel and the primary action ("Save", "Send the invitation"; Delete for an existing redirect, whose confirmation now says what deleting does) in the footer. Each form registers with `useUnsavedChanges({ bar: false })`, so leaving the screen asks and Cmd/Ctrl+S saves it; a new role or invitation with nothing typed has no unsaved changes. A saved role, a sent invitation or a saved or deleted redirect closes the slideover and says so above the list; Super admin still only explains that it cannot be edited; Import CSV stays in the header. The media details slideover asks the same before it closes or another item opens while alt text or a caption is unsaved; that text survives Replace file, Archive and Restore, and the fields are locked while a request runs.

The user screen's roles save from the unsaved-changes bar ("Save roles" is gone), and a language change, a deactivation, a reactivation or a refused save no longer resets unsaved role toggles; the admin language still applies at once; messages are green or red. The email template editor saves from the bar: Save stores every language whose subject or body differs from what emails use (its override, else the default), one after another, a refused language keeps its changes, shows why and opens its tab while the others save, and Discard puts every language back. The per-language Save button is gone; Preview, Send me a test and Reset to default stay, and a language with unsaved changes notes that the test uses the saved wording. "Send this email" still applies at once and now says whether it was saved (a failure turned it back without a word); Reset to default waits in its dialog until done.
