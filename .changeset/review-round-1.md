Review fixes. users: a session is created atomically with deactivation and password reset (migration 0002), invitations are checked and written under the users/roles lock, one pending invitation per address (migration 0003), and accepting an invitation is rate limited per address and checks the token before hashing the password. cms: redirect paths are decoded and canonical (dot segments, repeated slashes) for writes, CSV import and lookup; backslashes and `//` are refused. emails: the retry cap holds when a last attempt was cut off; public emails use core's content locales (the `contentLocales` option is removed); bodies are sanitized with sanitize-html instead of xss. core: composition refuses the Authorization middleware or a Policy on a public group.
